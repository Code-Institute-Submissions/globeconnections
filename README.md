### UX

- The reason behind creating this website is to allow site navigators to choose a package for their next holiday which is best suited to their individual requirements.

- We understand that every traveller is different from another and will have sveeral different requirements to fulfil throughout their journey to ensure that they have the best holiday possible.

- I have created this website using the latest color schemes, keeping it simple yet in line with latest designing trends.

- The search functionalities provided in my website allow the site navigator to gain access to various services provided by the company to meet their individual requirements.

- I have provided users with access to information about the following resources via the Google Maps APIs, close to their chosen destination :

**1. Hotels (Accommodation/lodging)**
**2. Restaurants**
**3. Local Tourist Attractions**

- The site users can then look at markers for the search results on the map provided within this website.

- My aim was to make the website easy to navigate, self-explanatory, visually appealing and provided a smooth shopping experience to users from all walks of life.

**The wireframes have been attached to a separate folder named ***Wireframes*** within this Github repository**.
