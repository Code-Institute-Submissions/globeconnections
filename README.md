 # UX

 ### User stories:

- The reason behind creating this website is to allow site navigators to choose a package for their next holiday which is best suited to their individual requirements.

### Scope:

- We understand that every traveller is different from another and will have several different requirements to fulfil throughout their journey to ensure that they have the best holiday possible.

### Surface:

- I have created this website using the latest color schemes, keeping it simple yet in line with latest designing trends.

### Strategy:

- My aim was to make the website easy to navigate, self-explanatory, visually appealing and provide a smooth shopping experience to users from all walks of life.

### Structure:

- The search functions provided in my website allow the site navigator to gain access to various services provided by the company to meet their individual requirements.

- I have provided users with access to information about the following resources via the Google Maps APIs, close to their chosen destination:

**1. Hotels (Accommodation/lodging)**

**2. Restaurants**

**3. Local Tourist Attractions**

- The site users can then look at markers highlighting the search results on the map provided within this website.

### Skeleton:

- [LARGE-SCREENS-WIREFRAMES](/assets/wireframes/large-screens-wireframe-GLOBECONNECTIONS.pdf "wireframe for large-sized screens").
- [MEDIUM-SCREENS-WIREFRAMES](/assets/wireframes/medium-screens-wireframe-GLOBECONNECTIONS.pdf "wireframe for medium-sized screens").
- [SMALL-SCREENS-WIREFRAMES](/assets/wireframes/small-screens-wireframe-GLOBECONNECTIONS.pdf "wireframe for small-sized screens").
