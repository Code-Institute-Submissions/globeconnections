Project Name: don Miguel Ruiz (User-Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute)
Combining Toltec mythology and scientific perspectives, don Miguel has been able to merge ancient wisdom with modern physics and practical common-sense, forging a new philosophy for seekers of truth and personal authenticity. His landmark bestselling book, The Four Agreements, contains practical steps for long-term, personal transformation and has been read by millions around the world.

First published in 1997, The Four Agreements has since sold over six million copies in the United States and seven million worldwide. It has been translated into 40 languages, appeared on the New York Times bestseller for nearly ten years, and was the 36th bestselling book of the decade. Don Miguel is also the author of The Mastery of Love, The Voice of Knowledge, Prayers, and the New York Times bestseller, The Fifth Agreement, a collaboration with his son, don José Ruiz. Each of his books are international bestsellers.

The wisdom don Miguel has brought to the world has earned him respect around the globe. He has dedicated his life to sharing his message through practical concepts in order to promote transformation and ultimately change lives for the better. Don Miguel is the recipient of numerous recognitions, including a U.S. Air Force 'challenge coin' engraved with "The Four Agreements." He is the recipient of an Honorary Degree in Cultural and Social Education from the American Cultural Institute of Mexico, and referenced as a "national treasure" in his native country.

The sole purpose of recreating his website is to demonstrate my web development skills. I aim to give as much information as possible about the author whilst keeping website visitors engaged in meaningful content and a very soothing web-design.

TECHNOLOGIES USED TO CREATE THIS WEBSITE:
1) HTML5: HTML5 is a software solution stack that defines the properties and behaviors of web page content by implementing a markup based pattern to it. HTML5 is the fifth and current major version of HTML, and subsumes XHTML. The current standard, the HTML Living Standard is developed by WHATWG, which is made up of the major browser vendors (Apple, Google, Mozilla, and Microsoft), with the Living Standard also existing in an abridged version. HTML5 is used in the creation of this website. Link to the official website: https://html.spec.whatwg.org/

2) CSS: CSS is the latest evolution of the Cascading Style Sheets language and aims at extending CSS2.1. It brings a lot of long-awaited novelties, like rounded corners, shadows, gradients, transitions or animations, as well as new layouts like multi-columns, flexible box or grid layouts. Experimental parts are vendor-prefixed and should either be avoided in production environments, or used with extreme caution as both their syntax and semantics can change in the future. CSS has been used in the creation of this website. Link to the official website: https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/

3) Bootstrap 4.3.1: Bootstrap is a free and open-source CSS framework directed at responsive, mobile-first front-end web development. It contains CSS- and (optionally) JavaScript-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation and other interface components. Bootstrap, originally named Twitter Blueprint, was developed by Mark Otto and Jacob Thornton at Twitter as a framework to encourage consistency across internal tools. Before Bootstrap, various libraries were used for interface development, which led to inconsistencies and a high maintenance burden. Bootstrap 4.3.1 has been used in the creation of this website. Link to the official website: https://getbootstrap.com/

TESTING:
The website usability tests were thoroughly conducted using the following parameters and resources:

Devtools: https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/

The screen sizes tested on devtools are as follows:

(1) Galaxy S5

(2) Pixel 2

(3) Pixel 2 XL

(4) iPhone 5/SE

(5) iPhone 6/7/8

(6) iPhone 6/7/7 Plus

(7) iPhone X

(8) iPad

(9) iPad Pro

(10) Desktop/desktop-touch

These devtools were tested on all the five pages of the website and across browsers such as the Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox and many others using the following website:
Browsershot

The other validators used throughout the website are as follows:

(1) https://validator.w3.org/

(2) https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/

During the testing session, two broken links were found and fixed on the index.html carousel. The button on the books.html page was found to be out of place and was aligned using CSS.

No errors were found when conducting the following tests on the contact form:

Contact form: Go to the "Contact Us" page Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

The website works perfectly fine on all screen sizes and browsers tested with the tools listed above.

There were no bugs left unfixed.
