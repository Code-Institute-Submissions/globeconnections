 **ABOUT GLOBECONNECTIONS:**

*The way we see it, life is just one big journey, and we're here to help people make more enlightening stops along the way. But what does that mean, exactly?*

*It means helping them have more fun dreaming and planning by offering up trip and destination ideas that range from time-tested to unexpected via Inspire.*

*Giving them more fulfilling journeys and more cherished memories by delivering innovative products at Globeconnections Customer First Guarantee that provides personal support before, during and after the trip.*

 ## UX

- The reason behind creating this website is to allow site navigators to choose a package for their next holiday which is best suited to their individual requirements.

- We understand that every traveller is different from another and will have sveeral different requirements to fulfil throughout their journey to ensure that they have the best holiday possible.

- I have created this website using the latest color schemes, keeping it simple yet in line with latest designing trends.

- The search functionalities provided in my website allow the site navigator to gain access to various services provided by the company to meet their individual requirements.

- I have provided users with access to information about the following resources via the Google Maps APIs, close to their chosen destination:

**1. Hotels (Accommodation/lodging)**


**2. Restaurants**


**3. Local Tourist Attractions**


- The site users can then look at markers for the search results on the map provided within this website.

- My aim was to make the website easy to navigate, self-explanatory, visually appealing and provided a smooth shopping experience to users from all walks of life.

**The wireframes have been attached to a separate folder named ***Wireframes*** within this Github repository**.
