 # 1) UX:

## User stories:

- The reason behind creating this website is to allow site navigators to choose a package for their next holiday which is best suited to their individual requirements.

## (a) Scope:

- We understand that every traveller is different from another and will have several different requirements to fulfil throughout their journey to ensure that they have the best holiday possible.

## (b) Surface:

- I have created this website using the latest color schemes, keeping it simple yet in line with latest designing trends.

## (c) Strategy:

- My aim was to make the website easy to navigate, self-explanatory, visually appealing and provide a smooth shopping experience to users from all walks of life.

## (d) Structure:

- The search functions provided in my website allow the site navigator to gain access to various services provided by the company to meet their individual requirements.

- I have provided users with access to information about the following resources via the Google Maps APIs, close to their chosen destination:

**(1) Hotels**

**(2) Restaurants**

**(3) Local Tourist Attractions**

**(4) Search for nearby places close to any city in the world**

- The site users can then look at markers highlighting the search results on the map provided within this website.

## (e) Skeleton:

- [LARGE-SCREENS-WIREFRAMES](/assets/wireframes/large-screens-wireframe-GLOBECONNECTIONS.pdf "wireframe for large-sized screens")
- [MEDIUM-SCREENS-WIREFRAMES](/assets/wireframes/medium-screens-wireframe-GLOBECONNECTIONS.pdf "wireframe for medium-sized screens")
- [SMALL-SCREENS-WIREFRAMES](/assets/wireframes/small-screens-wireframe-GLOBECONNECTIONS.pdf "wireframe for small-sized screens")

*The live website is slightly different from the one depicted in the wireframes because some features and styles were amended whilst enhancing the website.*
