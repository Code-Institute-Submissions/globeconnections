**ABOUT GLOBECONNECTIONS:**

*Here at Globeconnections, we believe that fulfilling travel experiences begin not only with choosing the right destination, but having the right state of mind.*

*The way we see it, life is just one big journey, and we're here to help people make more enlightening stops along the way. But what does that mean, exactly?*

*It means helping them have more fun dreaming and planning by offering up trip and destination ideas that range from time-tested to unexpected via Inspire.*

*Giving them more fulfilling journeys and more cherished memories by delivering innovative products at Globeconnections Customer First Guarantee that provides personal support before, during and after the trip.*

*And of course, reminding them to bring snacks on long flights. (Always keep some granola in your carry-on, trust us.)*
