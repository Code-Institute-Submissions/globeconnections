 # 1) UX:

## USER STORIES:

- *As a customer, I want to find the best package/rates for my next trip.*

- *As a traveller, I want a diverse and an easy shopping experience to find my next holiday destination.*

## (a) SCOPE:

- *We understand that each traveller is different from another and will have several different requirements to fulfil throughout their journey to ensure that they have the best holiday possible.*

- *I wish to allow customers to choose a package that is suitable for their unique requirements and also provide travellers with the choice of selecting inidividual services offered by the company to make their journey an unforgettable one.*

## (b) SURFACE:

- *I have created this website using one of the latest [color schemes](/assets/images/palette.pdf "coolors.com - The super fast color schemes generator"), keeping it simple, yet in line with the latest designing trends.*

## (c) STRATEGY:

- *My aim was to make the website easy to navigate, self-explanatory, visually appealing and provide a smooth shopping experience to site navigators from all walks of life.*

## (d) STRUCTURE:

- *The search functions provided within my website allow site navigators to gain access to various services provided by the company to meet their individual requirements.*

- *I have provided site navigators with access to information about the following resources via the Google Maps APIs, closer to their chosen destination:*

**(1) Hotels**

**(2) Restaurants**

**(3) Local Tourist Attractions**

**(4) Search for nearby places around any city in the world.**

- *The site navigators can then look at markers highlighting the search results on the map provided within this website.*

## (e) SKELETON:

- *The design for this website is depicted in the wire-frames attached below to demonstrate how it is supposed to display on small, medium and large screen sizes:*

*(iii) [SMALL-SCREENS-WIRE-FRAMES](/assets/wireframes/small-screens-wireframe-GLOBECONNECTIONS.pdf "wireframe for small-sized screens")*

- *The live website is slightly different from the one depicted in the wire-frames because some features and styles were amended whilst enhancing the website.*
